## Introduction

The Memory Game is a classic card matching game designed to test your memory and concentration skills. The objective is to find all matching pairs of cards in the least amount of time and with the fewest moves.

## Instructions

Click on a card to reveal its symbol. Click on a second card to try and find a match. If the symbols match, the cards will remain face up. If they don't match, the cards will flip back face down. Continue matching pairs until all cards are matched.

## Functionality

This Memory Game includes several features to enhance gameplay:

*   **Shuffling Cards**: At the start of each game, the cards are shuffled to ensure a unique and challenging experience every time you play. This randomization tests your memory and prevents you from relying on previously learned patterns.

*   **Matching Check**: The game enforces a strict two-card matching rule. Only two cards can be selected at a time. Once two cards are selected, no other card can be selected until the matching attempt is resolved (either the cards match or are flipped back down).

*   **Timer**: A timer tracks the time elapsed during the game, adding a time-based challenge to improve your speed and efficiency in matching pairs.

*   **Star Rating**: Your performance is evaluated based on the number of moves and time taken to complete the game. A star rating system provides a visual representation of your skill level, encouraging you to strive for better results.

*   **Moves Count**: The game counts the number of moves you make, allowing you to monitor your progress and strategize to minimize unnecessary clicks.

## Enjoy the challenge and have fun playing the Memory Game!
